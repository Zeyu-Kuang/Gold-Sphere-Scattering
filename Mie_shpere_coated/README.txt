Mie_Matlab_Maetzler_v2_2
For pHd (coating particles). A Fitting model is created.

Data of pHd_scs: pHd_scs_pH0, pHd_scs_pH7

Different parameters of fitting were created. If the parameters are too much, the program would be unstable.
One parameter's fitting is recommanded. (Promgram: pHd_fitting_1_par_for_plot)

One parameter's fitting only considers the fitting of the thickness of the coated material.
For the function of the other programs, please see the comment inside the .m files.
